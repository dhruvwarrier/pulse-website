# pulse-website
Website for Pulse, a startup I co-founded in May this year. Pulse is sponsored by the Entrepreneurship Hatchery, a startup incubator at University of Toronto.

We're currently researching how to improve the events experience for attendees and event organizers, with a focus on networking-based events.

Joshua Park was responsible for the design under artboards/.
