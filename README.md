# pulse-website
Website for Pulse, a startup idea that I explored for 4 months in the summer of 2018. Pulse was sponsored by the Entrepreneurship Hatchery, a startup incubator at University of Toronto.

We were researching how to improve the events experience for attendees and event organizers, with a focus on networking-based events.

Joshua Park was responsible for the design under artboards/.
